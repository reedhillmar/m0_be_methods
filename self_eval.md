# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of? *I'm most proud of the help and insight I was able to give others. I enjoyed digging deeper into a command and making sure I understood it and then using that to explain it to others. It helped to reinforce my own understanding as well.*
- What is the power of using methods in our applications? *The power of methods in applications is the ability to run the same operations multiple times without having to code the full operation each time.*
